# rings

Mutable Instruments Rings (Emilie Gillet, MIT) as a coop synth engine: a physical-modelling resonator with six models
and up to six voices. The DSP is te-op1-cfw's fixed-point port (`ports/rings`, commit 5aa314b), the build hundekraft's
kennel plugin used (`ports/knl/rings`): 22.05 kHz with 32-sample control blocks, upsampled 4x to the stock voice rate.
E3 in `docs/engines.md`.

## Controls (guidelines §3.2)

| | Blue | Green | White | Orange |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Turn | structure | brightness | damping | position |
| Click | — | — | — | — |
| Shift + turn | structure fine | brightness fine | damping fine | position fine |
| Shift + click | — | — | — | — |
| fn + turn | model (6 steps, 2 detents a step) | polyphony (4 steps) | — | — |
| fn + click | — | — | — | — |
| Shift + fn + turn | — | — | — | — |
| Shift + fn + click | — | — | — | — |

- Model: `modal` (modal resonator), `symp` (sympathetic strings), `string` (inharmonic string), `fm` (FM voice),
  `quant` (quantized sympathetic strings), `verb` (string and reverb). Polyphony: `all` (6 voices, 14 modes each),
  `1` (60 modes), `2` (28), `4` (12), Rings' own trade of voices for modes; string and reverb plays `all` as 4.
- Both are latched at note on: a change applies from the next note and never clicks a ringing voice.
- Stored in knob words 5 and 6 as the step index (plugin.json `controls`), saved with the sound; the core shows
  `MODEL VERB` etc. when one moves, and the screen draws both rows, bracketed while fn is held.
- Velocity is not used (as in the kennel build). The stock envelope, gain and LFO follow the render.

**Upstream mapping.** Kennel rings: the four turns as here; a blue press flipped blue to page 2, where it turned the
model (word 5, 1536 a click), a green press flipped green to page 2 for the polyphony (word 6). coop retires the
page-2 toggle (guidelines §4: every layer is held), and the owner put both on fn + turn (2026-11-10). The words now
hold step indexes; a sound saved by kennel decodes clamped (an out-of-range word plays as the last step).

## Screen

Kennel rings' own screen (`rings.svg`, from `gen_rings_svg.py`, unchanged): the rings light from the core with
structure, the rays with brightness (flashing with the loudest voice), the pad lifts with damping, the strike dot
moves with position, one ripple per sounding voice; MODEL and POLY on the right. While fn is held the rows are
bracketed with white labels and the rings and rays dim (`coop_scr_mods`). Inputs: `coop_scr_words`, and the voices'
levels from the engine (`RingsScreenVoices`).

## Memory, L1, cost

- File 111,132 bytes; `.text` 42,264, `.rodata` 49,072, `.bss` 573,824 (six voice states and the shared reverb,
  raw storage set up by `init`). One relocation (engines are relocated once): ~665 KB of heap 0.
- L1: the per-call scratch (render buffers, the mode bank's and string kernels' per-sample buffers, the upsampler's
  work area: 748 bytes) in the core's scratchpad loan (`coop_l1_scratch`, 1312 bytes), and the limiter's soft-limit
  table (1,028 bytes, read every sample of every voice) in the lease (`coop_l1_lease`, 1,056 bytes taken). SDRAM
  fallbacks for both. The other tables are read per block, or are too big (the FM model's 16 KB sine table).
- Cost, op1emu (e4c image, `tests/sim/det_eng_rings.txt`: every model, six-voice chords, steals at polyphony 1):
  `eng_rings=15124/32128/118600` per voice render, `eng_rings_block=85742/153017/20920` per block (avg / max / n;
  the budget is 580,499 a block: 15 % / 26 %). **Emulator figures; the device is 10-35 % higher. Device: pending.**

## Building and checking

```sh
make -C plugins                      # build/plugins/rings.coop
make -C tests/host/rings             # bit-identical to te-op1-cfw's engine over a 90 s scenario
```

## Differences from te-op1-cfw

The DSP files (`src/`, `op1/`) are te-op1-cfw's, with only what coop's rules require changed:
- **No float or double in any file** (guidelines §2.1): upstream's compile-time constants (`Q(x, n)`, `St(x)`,
  `LfoIncrement(hz)`, `FFloat(double)`) are integer literals, made by `defloat.py` with the same IEEE double arithmetic
  as GCC's constexpr evaluation at 22.05 kHz; the original expression stays in a comment beside each. `FFloat` gains
  `Raw(m, e)`; the host-only float helpers are gone.
- **No firmware addresses** (§2.1): `op1/op1.h` keeps only block size, voice count, the cycle counter (a register) and
  saturation; the engine (`rings.cc`, from `op1/engine.cc`) takes voice, pitch and knobs from its arguments, and the
  scratch from the core (`src/scratch.h`).
- **No libc, no static constructors**: the debug `printf` is gone, `StringFixed::CopyRecentFrom` copies by bytes, the
  voice states and reverb are raw `.bss` (their `FFloat` members have constructors), `op1/support.cc` gives the
  compiler's own `memcpy` / `memset` calls (struct copies) their plugin-local bodies, as kennel did.
- `op1/settings.h` decodes words 5 and 6 as step indexes (`OP1_COOP`).

The host test (`tests/host/rings/rings_compare.cc`) builds te-op1-cfw's own engine and this one from the same seeded
call sequence (4,367 notes, every model and polyphony pair, knob jumps, bends, steals, idle gaps): the outputs are
bit-identical, and a 1-LSB change to a live constant makes them differ.
