# Device tests

coop-fw packages are built here and flashed by the owner. Every test package:
- leaves out `te-boot.ldr`;
- passes `tools/verify_bootloader.py`;
- decodes to stock firmware 246 with only `OP1_vdk.ldr` changed (`tools/pkg_check.py`).

Recovery always works the same way: hold COM at power-on, choose "1. Upload firmware", and copy stock
`op1_246.op1`. That path runs before any app code (`docs/brick-safety.md`). Proven on the owner's unit
2026-10-14 (te-op1-cfw Test 1).

## Protocol

Each test gets a numbered section below: package name, what changed against stock (blocks, patched words),
the procedure as numbered steps, what to read back (screen page, beep sequence, file on the disk-mode drive),
and the result as numbered points matching the steps. Numbering continues from te-op1-cfw's device tests, which
ended at Test 63.

How results come back without JTAG:
- **screen**: a readout page drawn with the stroke font (white click pages, as te-op1-cfw cpuprobe);
- **file**: written to `/yaffs2/user/` by a main-loop hook, copied off in disk mode;
- **beeps**: `te-op1-cfw/tools/decode_probe_beeps.py` on a phone recording;
- **photo**: a phone photo of the screen when a number must be exact.

## Test 64: L1 dumper (Phase 1)

**Package:** built from `tools/dump_l1/` injected into region C; see `tools/dump_l1/README.md` for
the exact build, inject, package and verify commands, and the on-device read-back.

What changed against stock (confirmed by `pkg_check.py`): only `OP1_vdk.ldr`, and inside it only the
main-loop tape-service CALL at `0x019F0A24` (retargeted to the payload's `ServiceHook`, stock target
`0x01A54710` re-checked by `inject_app.py`) plus the appended region-C code/FILL blocks. The package
passes `verify_bootloader.py` (no `te-boot.ldr`).

**Procedure (owner):**
1. Prove stock recovery once (COM at power-on, flash stock `op1_246.op1`).
2. Flash the dumper package through the te-boot menu.
3. Boot normally, wait a few seconds.
4. Disk mode, copy `user/coop_l1.bin` off.
5. Reflash stock.

**Read back / HARD GATE (offline):**
- `l1_decrypt.py check-key` with the key bytes from `coop_l1.bin` must print a matching arrangement.
- `l1_decrypt.py compare` of the decrypted CALLBACK blocks against the `0xffa00000` region in the
  dump must report **zero mismatches**. Phase 2 does not start until it does.

**Run 1 (2026-11-01): HANG on the loading screen.** Two bugs, both fixed:
1. The dumper read L1 through MDMA0 (`0xffc00f00`), which is the firmware's display-copy engine
   (memory-map.md 5; confirmed: MDMA0 registers have many references in the disassembly, MDMA1 none).
   Seizing it mid-boot broke the display DMA, hence the hang. Fix: the minimal build no longer uses
   DMA at all (L1 data and the key are read by ordinary loads); only the optional `DUMP_L1CODE`
   build reads L1 instruction SRAM, and it uses MDMA1 with a bounded wait.
2. `ServiceHook` was declared `(void* self, int arg)`, but the stock tape service takes one `int` in
   R0 (kennel's `STOCK_SERVICE` is `int(*)(int)`). The forwarded call passed the wrong registers.
   Fix: `ServiceHook(int arg)`, forwarding `((int(*)(int))0x01A54710)(arg)`.

**Run 2 plan (one thing at a time):**
- `op1_246_coop_canary.op1`: the hook only forwards to the stock service (72 bytes). Boots cleanly =>
  the CALL-retarget hook and signature are sound.
- then `op1_246_coop_dump.op1`: DMA-free capture of the key + L1 data, writes `coop_l1.bin`.
- then `op1_246_coop_dump_otp.op1` / `_full.op1`: add the OTP (boot ROM) and L1 instruction SRAM
  (MDMA1) once the minimal path works.

**Resolution (2026-11-01):** the Phase 1 gate was met a different way, without run 2. The OTP key is
the same on every OP-1, so the public reference dump (Tolsi/op1dumps) is valid for this unit;
`l1_decrypt.py check-key` verified it against kennel's `l1_patches.json` pairs, and the full L1
decrypts to real code (see `docs/l1-map.md`). The dumper builds (canary/minimal/otp/full) remain
available for an optional device-vs-emulator cross-check but are not needed for the gate.

## Phase 2 milestone C1/C2: stereo instrument bus — device test (PASS, 2026-11-02)

Built by `tools/build_device_package.sh` (sha256 in `build/pkg/`, copies in `C:\Users\byron\Downloads`):
- `op1_246_coop_c1_spread0.op1` — the regression image: must sound and behave exactly like stock
  (every stock path runs; coop adds hooks that do nothing at spread 0). Emulator: sample-identical.
- `op1_246_coop_c1_spreadfull.op1` — `g_coop_spread=32767`: each synth note lands at a random stereo
  position (headphones/line out; the speaker sums to mono by design), drums too per voice.

Both: no `te-boot.ldr`, `verify_bootloader.py` PASS, `pkg_check.py` = only `OP1_vdk.ldr` differs,
L1 re-encrypted with the check-key arrangement and round-trip verified (`tools/build_image.sh --device`).
Read `docs/brick-safety.md`; flash spread0 first.

**What to record:** boots to the tape screen; synth + drums play; no clicks/pumping under a 6-note
chord with an insert FX on (loop B replacement + hooks in the audio path); headphones: spread0 mono
image as stock, spreadfull voices spread L/R and total loudness unchanged; UI fps unchanged (perf gate,
`docs/performance.md`). If the device is silent or hangs: the mix thunk's register save set
(`stereo_thunks.S`) is the first suspect, then the region-C trampoline at `0x01e00000`.

**Result (2026-11-02, owner):** `op1_246_coop_c1_spreadfull.op1` (sha256 `6f100465...`) flashed first (the
owner's call). Boots, plays, \"sounds great\" [C]: the stereo instrument bus, the pan-at-note-on hook
(region-C trampoline at `0x01e00000`, `Core::NoteOn` callers patched), the replaced mix loop B, the
LFO2 pre-render thunks (slot off) and the coop payload at region A all run on the device without
silence, hang or audible artefacts. This is the first coop audio-path image confirmed on hardware.
Not yet recorded: the spread0 regression image on the device (emulator: stock bit for bit), a
measured fps/perf check (`docs/performance.md`), and a six-voice chord with an insert FX under
headphones for clicks. Those stay on the list for the next flash.
